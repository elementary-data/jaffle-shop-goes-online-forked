models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: This model represents a staging table for customer data. It serves
      as the initial layer of the data model, transforming raw customer data from
      the `jaffle_shop.raw_customers_validation` table into a more structured and
      standardized format. The key transformations performed include extracting the
      `customer_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` fields from the source data.

  - name: stg_orders
    description: This model represents the stage table for orders in the finance and
      sales domain. It ingests data from the `raw_orders_validation` table in the
      `jaffle_shop` schema and performs basic transformations, including renaming
      columns to more business-friendly names (e.g., `id` to `order_id`, `user_id`
      to `customer_id`) and selecting only the relevant columns (`order_id`, `customer_id`,
      `order_date`, `status`). This staged data can be used by downstream data consumers
      for further analysis and reporting on order-related metrics and trends.

  - name: stg_payments
    description: This model, `stg_payments`, is a staging table that contains payment
      data from the `raw_payments_validation` table in the `jaffle_shop` schema. It
      serves the purpose of providing a clean, standardized view of the payment data
      for downstream analysis and reporting. The model performs a simple transformation,
      converting the `amount` column from cents to dollars to make the data more human-readable.
