models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: This model, `stg_customers`, represents the staging table for customer
      data in the Jaffle Shop ecommerce application. It extracts and renames the key
      customer attributes, such as `customer_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`, from
      the raw `raw_customers_validation` table. This staging model serves as a centralized
      and curated source of customer information, which can be used by downstream
      data models and reporting tools to gain insights into customer behavior and
      demographics.

  - name: stg_orders
    description: This model, `stg_orders`, represents a staging table for order data
      from the `jaffle_shop` dataset. It serves the finance and sales domains by providing
      a clean, standardized version of the raw order data, with key fields such as
      `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `status`. The model performs a
      simple renaming of the source columns to more business-friendly names, making
      the data more accessible and easier to understand for downstream data consumers.
